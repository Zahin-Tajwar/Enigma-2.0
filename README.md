# Enigma-2.0
**The Enigma machine is a cipher device developed and used in the early- to mid-20th century to protect commercial, diplomatic, and military communication.**

**This is a simplified recreation of the World War II Enigma Machine used by German soldiers to encrypt messages in wartime.**

### Instructions
To begin encrypting a message, choose the initial rotor positions by dragging the sliders labelled under 'Rotor I', 'II' and'III'.
Record this 3-letter combination by clicking Export after clicking Run.

Now, enter the encrypted message in Capital Letters in the first text-box (with an X to represent spaces, ZZ to represent
commas and FRAQ to represent a question mark) under the rotor sliders and click run. (Historically, the Enigma Machine only took
in capital letters like a typewriter with a capital X to represent spaces and had no options for more elaborate writing, the
decrypted message would just include the X, ZZ or FRAQ which was manually understood by soldiers on the other end). The encrypted
message will be shown in the second text box under the Run button. Also there is no cause to be alarmed over the rotor
sliders changing position.

To save this encrypted text (the same is true for decrypted text) or if the text is too long too be displayed in the text-box,
click export to save it in a .txt file in the same directory where the program is. The message will be followed
by a record of the initial rotor settings you used while encrypting/decrypting in the exported txt file.

Click Clear to refresh both text-boxes and start encrypting or decrypting a new message. Be aware that the initial rotor positions
you recorded for your last message have changed to something else now and if you want to keep using the same recorded combination
as earlier, you will have to drag the sliders back to the settings you want to use. If you want to continuously encrypt messages
while still keeping track of the initial settings being used-you can click run to encrypt multiple times and click export at the
end to have a list of messages followed by their initial settings recorded in the txt file.

To let a friend on another end decrypt your message, send him the exported txt file, also the Enigma Machine. 

To decrypt a message you have received, set the sliders according to the three letter combination, enter the encrypted message in the first textbox and click Run. Everything is exactly the same for both
processes except a random combination cannot be chosen while decrypting and the inputs and outputs for the text are inverted.

Click Quit when you are done with encrypting or decrypting message and sleep in peace
(unless the person trying to eavesdrop on it is Alan TuringüòÅ).
